Kusaba Helma
===

General improvement for [Helma](http://www.helma.xyz/), which is based on [Kusaba X 0.9.3](http://sourceforge.net/projects/kusabax/).
This project aims to bring Helma with Kusaba up to speed with the current
implementations of imageboard. Some examples would be auto-updating and
inline-quoting.


Why don't you use `x` instead?
---

The system has been working for years. We are merely adding features to it, so
Helma could be more functional. Using another imageboard software is possible,
but it would be a hassle to port the code and database.
